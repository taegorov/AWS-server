    Choose a server youâ€™ve built previously
        Option 1: A simple API or Web Server
        Option 2: A socket.io event Hub

    Using the same server, create a new environment using Elastic Beanstalk from your terminal
    Manually deploy your application to this environment by using eb deploy

## Processes

My process was pretty much just following along with what Jacob did in class. I also leveraged my classmates Cullen Sharp and Keian Anthony for help.
